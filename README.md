# Jensen
Automation tool for real estate agents

## Windows
To run Jensen download the Jensen.zip from the releases page and unzip to your local file system.  In the "main" folder simply execute the "main.exe"

## Mac
Currently the executable that comes out of pyinstaller is not working for Mac so Jensen has to be executed via command line.

Follow these steps to launch the Jensen application:  
1. Clone the project to a location on your computer (currently don't have to worry about this).  Typical location is: `/users/<username>/Documents/Jensen`
2. Open the terminal application by going to "Launchpad->Other->Terminal"
3. Navigate to the Jensen application by running the following command:   
`cd /users/<username>/Documents/Jensen`
4. Run Jensen by executing the following command:  
`source ./JensenMac`
